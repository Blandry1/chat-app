In-Process:
-change timestamp depending when it was sent.
--call time.js at periodic intervals or at a certain trigger.
-save message history of a chat room

Todo:
-add multiple user locations pings on one google.map
-add a facebook login requirement


Note:
-file index.html: The css color scheme changes on refresh for "Join chat room" page
--probably bc of css script is loaded after html page. And not enough time to load before the page gets displayed.

How-To:
--How do you git pull? & git diff?
--Why is message.test.js failing on 'npm test'?
