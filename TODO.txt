-complete Udemy Chat-app lessons
-change timestamp depending on how many days the last message was received (check playground/time.js for code & add it to index.js)
-add multiple user locations pings on one google.map


Note:
-file index.html: The css color scheme changes on refresh for "Join chat room" page
--probably bc of css script is loaded after html page. And not enough time to load before the page gets displayed.
